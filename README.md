# Movie Recommendation System

Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹
I created this movie recommendation web application for MS ENGAGE 
Program 2022. The website is fully functional and useable in real
life. This is easy to use.This allows consumers to select movies
 based on genre or personal preference. People can click on the 
 movie they want to see and be taken to the imbd site ofÂ that 
 film. I used agile methodaology for this project as
  mentioned as part of this program. I divided my whole task 
  into 4 weeks. I started completing my tasks as sprint wise 
  that helped in smooth learing and building the product.

## Deep design of website with features:

## Tech Stack used for project:

**Frontend:** Frontend is made by streamlit framework of python and by using HTML/CSS

**Backend:** For backend two algorithims are used 
- Cosine similarity : This algorithm is used to propose movies based on their content, as it compares similarities across the movie datasets.
- K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm : KNN algorithm is an item based collaborative filtering technique,  a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. 


## Layout of website from PC:

## Functionality
Gives the customer the option of receiving movie choices based on genre or receiving the selected movie and comparable sorts.
The user can also acquire genre-based movies based on their imbd rating.
For the recommended movies, the user receives a poster and a link to the imbd site.


## How to run locally?

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://https://github.com/NishaDathak/Engage2022.git
```


Install dependencies

```bash
  pip intsall streamlit
  pip install pandas
  pip install streamlit_lottie
```

Start the server

```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```


## Sprint sheet of week to week task by using Aglie methodology:
- AGILE METHODOLOGY:- In this methodology, I divided my whole task into 4 week sprint program, and proceeded step by step from learning , building and deploying the project. Whatever I learned, explored, researched during this program is fully detailed below:

- WEEK 1 :

   **1** Being newbie I explored the problem statements 
   
   **2** Explored Agile Methodology :Learned and planned how I will manage things sprint vise using agile.		

   **3** Research on streamlit framework,python,availabe data for project

   **4** Decided tech stack



- WEEK 2 : 
   
   **1** Research on streamlit and learning how to code in it

   **2** Explored bag of words, tf-idf vectorization, KNN and Cosine similarity algorithims

   **3** Started working on backend using streamlit
   

- WEEK 3 : 
   
   **1** I gathered and filtered all of the necessary data, obtained an API to get posters.

   **2** Coded both the algorithms and combined it with data
   
   **3** Started working on frontend

   **4** Created home page,select box for movie recommendation

- WEEK 4 : 
   
   **1** Created home button 

   **2** Improved frontend by adding lotti animations and color
    
   **3** Giving final touch and finishing to project
   
   **4** Making of Video for Demo, documentation on github
